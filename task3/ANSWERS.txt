When answering questions about code, make sure your answer succinctly describes the in English or as a high-level mathematical expression. Answers that merely transcribe the code into English (e.g., "next, it adds register rax to register rdi") will receive no credit.

Your answers go below each question.


Q1: There are four call instructions in the first sixty bytes following the label _start. Each checks something about the input argument. What does each of them check, in the order they appear in the program?





Q2: The code is broken into several smaller functions. (For this task, we will define functions as targets of call instructions.) Reverse-engineer those functions.  For each function show below (a) the address, (b) what the function expects as the argument(s) and in which register(s), and (c) what the function computes.






Q3. Provide an example input that results in the hackme code assigned to you displaying "YOU WIN!"
